(a) Title: DATA 311 Final Project

(b) Author: Joshua Sonnen, Jeffrey Guo, Nate Galit, and Robert Bates 

(c) Dataset name: Inflating Car Prices

(d) Dataset description: With 5 car models selected from the dataset, wa_craig_cars.zip in https://github.com/reb8s/craig_cars.git, the given sale price of each of the vehicles every year they were produced. Along with the car data, the inflation rates from a given year to current are recorded. 

(e) Data provenance: With the absence of the data needed, a cvs file was built from the ground up using cars.com, and an inflation calculator to get the desired info. Using Excel, this made the process simple, yet tedious. 

(f) Intended usage: To cross analyze with used car selling prices to calculate the given depreciation rate of the top 5 given models, and determine the best value vehicle. 

(g) Data curation: Built from the ground up, by hand by Nate and Robert. 

(h) Data faults: None, built to specifications.
