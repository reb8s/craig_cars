(b) Author: Joshua Sonnen, Jeffrey Guo, Nate Galit, and Robert Bates 

(c) Dataset name: Washing Cars

(d) Dataset description: Craigslist car listings only in the state of Washington, with all given columns from the original dataset. This data will be cut accordingly for the project based upon what exploratory analysis is being done.

(e) Data provenance - Drew the original data from a kaggle dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data/data, which came from a users school project, where they scrapped Craigslist for all car listings within the United States. Searched the internet for datasets with mass amounts of listings with attributes of cars with the listings. 

(f) Intended usage: Using the listings, with prices and car atributes, a machine learning model is to be used to predict prices, analysis of most common cars and their given info, and general analyzing of data for US representation is what this data is to be used for.

(g) Data curation: With such a large dataset, just listings in the state of Washington were selected. With these given entries, categorical data is to be encoded using onehot with numerical data being kept. Listings links, location coordinates, and where the data came from has been removed due to not being needed. Due to the size of the original file, the data was cut in excel down to the size of just Washington and then loaded into a GitHub repo to have easy access.

(h) Data faults: Came very clean already, the sheer size of the dataset made it difficult to cut down.
